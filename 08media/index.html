        <p>Whales on their own are one of the most massive species to ever live. Even so not all whales are close in
            size. They come in a variety of different species, that vary in size and look. While whales or cetaceans can
            be lumped together in a category. They all have very distinct differences. With Cetacea having 94 species of
            whale that make up their category. One of the most distinct categories I can think of is their varying
            sizes. Cetaceans have some of the <strong>biggest</strong> creatures to exist in their species. Here are
            some of the largest species of Cetacean's:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>The Blue Whale is the largest whale out of all its species. Not only is this the largest in its own
                category, but it is also the biggest to have ever lived. They can also range from 90 to 110 feet!</li>
            <li>Next up we have the Fin Whale, this whale gets its name from the distinct feature on its back...the fin!
                Not only are these whales second in size to the blue whale, but their vocalization can also reach 190
                decibels underwater.</li>
            <li>Sperm whales rank third in size, they are also the biggest out of the toothed whales. They can also
                reach 40 to 52 ft depending on their sex. We have also learned that while the giants are some of the
                biggest, they are also some of the most hunted. The sperm whales were specifically <a href="collection.html#collection">hunted</a> for lubricants
                and candles.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>The LOUDEST Volcalization</h2>
        <p>Sperm whales have the been considered as having some of the loudest volcalizaitons ever. Here are some facts
            about their distict sounds!</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Their clicking sounds have been going as high as 230 decibels. This compares close to the sound of a
                volcano erupting.</li>
            <li>Sperm whales use the clicking sound you hear as part of their echolocaction!</li>
            <li>Their differnt varity of clicks and creaks makes up a wide web of communication. That can be linked to
                finding a mate, showing aggresion, or used to maintain thier group.</li>
        </ul>
